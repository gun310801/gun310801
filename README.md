# Hi there üëã I am Gunik

Data & AI Engineer building production-ready systems that turn chaotic data into intelligent automation. Currently building multi-agent AI workflows at Oncology Reference and exploring the intersection of LLMs, data engineering, and real-world impact.

## üöÄ What I Build

- Multi-agent AI systems using LangChain + CrewAI for automated content generation
- End-to-end ML pipelines processing millions of records with production-grade accuracy
- Intelligent data workflows that bridge research concepts with scalable implementations

## üîß Technologies & Tools I Use:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, NoSQL, Pyspark
- **AI/ML**:  LangChain, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, HuggingFace, RAG, AI Agents, CrewAI
- **Data & Cloud**: Pandas, Numpy, AWS, GCP, Docker, Git
- **Visualization**: Streamlit, Jupyter, Tableau, Plotly

## üîç Featured Projects
Check out some of the exciting projects I've worked on:
- [AI-Powered Financial Report Copilot](https://github.com/gun310801/FinAI-Copilot) - An AI Agent that generates financial reports using LangChain and custom metrics.
- [NYC Traffic collision Analysis](https://github.com/gun310801/NYC-Traffic-Collision-Analysis) - Led ETL on 5M records using PySpark, built a prediction models with 84% accuracy, and scaled the solution on GCP.
- [Real-Time Stock Data Analytics](https://github.com/gun310801/Real-Time-Stock-Data-Analytics) - A capstone Project for Chubb where I Developed a big data pipeline using AWS, Spark, and Kafka
- [SmartML](https://github.com/gun310801/SMARTML_GPT) - Automate manual finetuning, hyperparameter testing and feature engineering using LLMs and Agentic RAG. Useful Sr Data Scientist and Analysts
